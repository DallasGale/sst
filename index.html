                    Australian electronic music producer/ musican Dallas Gale
                    (aka
                    <em>Steady State Theory</em>) has released his debut EP
                    <strong>Attracts</strong> worldwide today. Using analogue
                    synths, drum machines, farfissa organ and sampled voice this
                    is the first of many recordings to come.

                <p class="paragraph secondary-text">
                    For the past 20 years Dallas has primarily been a guitar
                    player in some of Melbourne's most loved rock bands
                    including The In The Out, The Graveyard Sons, Deserters and
                    Dead River Deeps. However it's in the studio enviornment
                    that Dallas spends most of his nights.

                    On this EP Dallas has introduced sampling, especially with
                    vocals, that gives the music a unique quality because every
                    track will have a different voice attached to it.
